# [Store module] Steam group
Bonus for players that are in specific steam group.
To be honest I did almost nothing since I don't have any basic skills in C# and this plugin is much more copy paste from other open-source plugins such as:
- [Store-NameBonus by NaathySz (everything)](https://github.com/NaathySz/Store-NameBonus)
- [CS2-SteamGroupReward by daffyyyy (functions to fetch members from steam group and check players if they are in that specific steam group)](https://github.com/daffyyyy/CS2-SteamGroupReward)
